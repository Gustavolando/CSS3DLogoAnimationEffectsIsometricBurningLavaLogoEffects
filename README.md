# Isometric Burning Green Lava Logo Effects

I get inspired by this tutorial of Irshad from Online Tutorials:

This is a nice exercise of:
  - Using pure CSS and HTML to make a cool effect.
  - Tribute to Platzi Online School.
  - Applying a few concepts of 3d perspective, transformations and animations.
  - Practicing a litle of SASS.
